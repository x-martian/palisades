Palisades is a collection of essential algorithms and data structures written in an easy to reuse fashion based on the compile-time polymorphism programming paradigm.

The algorithms and supporting data structures currently implemented are:

Algorithms: quick sort, depth first search in graphs, graph random contraction.

Data Structures: Graph.
